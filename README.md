# STOCK ANALYSIS USING EXCEL VBA

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to perform a refactoring excercise on some previous written code that analyses stock prices of a limited number of stocks, and ensure that the code is optimized to perform the analysis on a greater number of stocks if required.

## Code Functionality

The original code prompts the user to select the year for analysis and process the respective years stock history data and calculates the yearly return of the stocks and output this in a results sheet. Formating the results to show the year return a a visaul cell formatting Green if the yearly return was positive and red if the yearly return was zero or negative.

## Refactoring Approach

### Objective

The primary purpose of this refactoring activity is to:- 

- Increase the readability and clarity of code.
- Ensure optimal performance.
- Ensure results are consistent with the original tested code.
- Ensure that no new errors are introduced and original; functionality is retained.

### Aproach

- To ensure redability and clarity of code , we will review and edit the code to ensure that variable names are clear and descriptibe , format code to ensure proper idententation.
- Code will be optimised by reducing any reduncies in the code , the performance will be measured by comparing run times of original code and refactored for identical data sets.
- To ensure refactored results are the same as the original code , we will compare the output results of the original code and the refactored code to ensure results match.
- To ensure no new errors are introduced we will test to ensure the code executes as the original code.

## Results

### Compare output results

The images below show side by side comparisons of run of the original code and the refactored code for 2017 and 2018 , both data sets are identical for each run.
